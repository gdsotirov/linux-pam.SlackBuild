linux-pam: Linux-PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules for Linux)
linux-pam:
linux-pam: Linux-PAM is a library that enables the local system administrator
linux-pam: to choose how individual applications authenticate users.
linux-pam: The purpose of the Linux-PAM project is to liberate the development
linux-pam: of privilege granting software from the development of secure and
linux-pam: appropriate authentication schemes.  This is accomplished by
linux-pam: providing a documented library of functions that an application
linux-pam: may use for all forms of user authentication management.  This
linux-pam: library dynamically loads locally configured authentication
linux-pam: modules that actually perform the authentication tasks.
